## Background
I bought a custom keyboard on AliExpress.
That keyboard was not registered in "REMAP".
However, the hardware itself seems to be compatible with QMK, and it was recognized by "REMAP" under the name "Cyber40".
Even though it was recognized, I was unable to change the settings.
I started this project to prepare the environment for this "Cyber40" and to gather information.
